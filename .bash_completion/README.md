To use this script, you need to save it in the `~/.bash_completion/` directory with an appropriate name, for example `nvidia-smi-mpl.bash-completion`. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_completion/nvidia-smi-mpl.bash-completion
```

Then paste the script into the file, save it and exit.

Finally, you need to source the script so that it is loaded into your current shell. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
source ~/.bash_completion/nvidia-smi-mpl.bash-completion
```

Now, when you type `nvidia-smi-mpl` followed by a space and then the TAB key, you will see the available options for the command.
